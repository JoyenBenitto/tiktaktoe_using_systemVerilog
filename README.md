#tiktaktoe_using_systemVerilog

The above code contains System verilog code for a tictactoe, circuit in hardware term the FPGA is connected to a  3*3 hex display and the code has 9 decoders that decodes and displays x and o
There is also a winning mechanism check which decices is the game ends or if its a tie.
